# Code Refactor Starter Code
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Changed the tags to the appropriate semantic tags.
Added alt attributes to all the images beside the background image. 
Reorganized the style sheet to follow same order has HTML for easier reading.
Consolidated the CSS code so that is no duplicate code. 
Added comments in both HTML and CSS for easy navigation and reading. 
Fixed broken Search Engine Optimization link. 
Deleted unnecessary class designations 
Cleaned up code with proper spacing and indents.
